## Requirements

- Open and read the vertex data from an .obj file ✓
- Your program must take the name of the .obj file as its first command-line argument ✓
- Set the camera transformation using two rotation angles and one translation that determines the distance of the object from the camera ✓
- The left mouse button (and drag) should adjust the camera angles ✓
- The right mouse button (and drag) should adjust the camera distance ✓
- Use perspective transformation for projection ✓
- Send the matrix to your vertex shader as a uniform parameter ✓

Additional Requirements 

- Pressing the F6 key should recompile your GLSL shaders ✓
- Center the object (using its bounding box) by adjusting the transformation matrix ✓
- Pressing the P key switches between perspective and orthogonal transformation ✓
- When using orthogonal transformation, use one over camera distance as a uniform scale factor ✓
